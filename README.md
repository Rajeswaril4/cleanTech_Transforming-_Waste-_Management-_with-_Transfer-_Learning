# Municipal Waste Classification

This project is a web application that uses a deep learning model to classify images of municipal waste into three categories: **Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash**. It provides a user-friendly interface to upload an image and receive a classification prediction, aiming to promote efficient recycling and better waste management.

## Features

* **Image Classification:** Upload a waste image and get an instant prediction.
* **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a fine-tuned VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a specialized waste dataset.
* **Web Interface:** A responsive and user-friendly interface built with Flask and standard web technologies.
* **Three Waste Categories:** Classifies waste into Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **WSGI Server:** Gunicorn
* **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
